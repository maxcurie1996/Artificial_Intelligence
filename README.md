# Artificial_Intelligence

## Folder 
The script has been divided into different folders: 


1. Methods: Different methods and models of machine learning
2. Applications: Different applications using machine learning models (such as anomaly detection). And specific 
3. Example_tensorflow: a comprehensive example file using TensorFlow 
4. Example_pytorch: a PyTorch ML examples 
5. Example_sklearn: sklearn examples
6. Debug: common ML-related bugs and how they happen 
7. Vitalization: common ways to Vitalize training data, ML models, and their predictions 
8. Featrue_enginner: Common ways to do feature engineer: augmentation, normalization, PCA, etc. 
9. Tunning: Common normalization methods
10. Large_model: common practice for training large model that uses multiple GPUs 
11. Theory: script of basic models made from scratch to demonstrate the theory 
12. Article: reading material that can be helpful 
13. 0_my_teaching: the lecture notes from the classes I taught 
14. Other: other miscellaneous scripts

I created a set of templates and examples on Neural Networks using TensorFlow:

## The naming system:

Demo_* : The demonstration to show some mechanism of Neural Network concept
 1. 
 2. 
Model_* : The model of different neutral network
 1. Model_CNN_1D: Convolutional Neutral Network in 1 dimensions
 2. Model_CNN_2D: Convolutional Neutral Network in 2 dimensions
 3. Model_Dropout: model with dropout layer to overcome overfitting
 4. Model_LR: 1 Neuron model that does linear regression 
 5. Model_LSTM: Long short-term memory that propagates effect
 6. Model_NLP_embedding_sentiment: model embedding the number to a vector, usually used          in Natural Language Processing

Example_* : The example of the different applications

Post_* : Post-processing toolbox 

Pre_* : Pre-processing toolbox
