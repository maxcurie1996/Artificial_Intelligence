I created a set of templates and examples on Neural Network using TensorFlow:

The naming system:

Demo_* : The demostration to show some mechinism of Neural Network concept
			1. 
			2. 
Model_* : The model of different neutral network
			1. Model_CNN_1D: Convolutional Neutral Network in 1 dimonsion
			2. Model_CNN_2D: Convolutional Neutral Network in 2 dimonsion
			3. Model_Dropout: model with dropout layer to overcome overfitting
			4. Model_LR: 1 Neuron model that does linear regression 
			5. Model_LSTM: Long short-term memory that propagate effect
			6. Model_NLP_embedding_sentiment: model embedding the number to a vector, usually used 			in Natrual Language Processing

Example_* : The example of the different applications

Post_* : Post-processing toolbox 

Pre_* : Pre-processing toolbox
